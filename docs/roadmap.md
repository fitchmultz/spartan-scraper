# Roadmap

This is the canonical source of truth for planned work, exploratory ideas, and sequencing.

## Planning Principles

- Treat the Web UI as a first-class operator surface. When parity work and workflow clarity compete, prioritize the product workflow that helps operators complete real tasks faster and with less confusion.
- Prefer feature symmetry across the primary product interfaces that carry the main operator and automation workflows: API, Web UI, CLI, and MCP, but do not preserve a poor Web UI solely for parity.
- Treat the TUI as an intentionally limited local inspection surface, not a feature-parity target, unless this roadmap explicitly says otherwise.
- Add AI enablement where it improves a real scraping, template-authoring, or results-analysis workflow; do not force AI into surfaces where it adds little operational value.
- Preserve route-per-major-feature information architecture at the top level, then use sub-routing or explicit in-route navigation inside complex Web surfaces when that materially improves clarity.
- Treat interface asymmetry as intentional only when this roadmap says so explicitly.
- Prefer roadmap ordering that limits churn in shared contracts, generated clients, and operator-facing docs.
- Put meaningful operator-facing product work ahead of maintenance, cleanup, and policy reminders.
- Treat focused failure-path dogfooding as acceptance criteria for major operator workflow cutovers, not as a standalone roadmap epic.

## Next

1. AI Automation Attempt History and Restore
   - Replace the current previous-vs-latest only retry memory with a full per-session attempt history for render-profile and pipeline-JS generate/debug flows.
   - Let operators select any earlier attempt as the comparison baseline, restore its guidance into the editor, and save that attempt directly without re-running the model.
   - Preserve the trust signals already added for every attempt: resolved goal, provider/model route, explanation, diff summary, and raw JSON access.
   - Keep the interaction model consistent across all four AI automation modals so operators learn one retry-review workflow and reuse it everywhere.
   - Add tests for multi-retry history retention, restoring a non-latest attempt, replacing the active comparison baseline, and saving a restored attempt without losing later history.

## Ongoing Constraints

- Keep the TUI scope frozen as a lightweight local inspector unless a future roadmap item explicitly justifies re-investing in it as a first-class surface.
- Preserve the current top-level Web route model (`/jobs`, `/jobs/new`, `/jobs/:id`, `/templates`, `/automation`, and `/settings`), but allow sub-routing or in-route navigation inside complex surfaces when that materially improves operator comprehension.
- Treat Web UI product-grade workflow improvements as higher priority than maintenance-only work and parity-only work until the primary operator journeys feel coherent, legible, and fast.
- No backwards-compatibility shims are required for the Web UI cutover. Prefer the cleaner immediate product model when redesign choices conflict.
